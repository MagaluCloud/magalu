# Utility Scripts

The scripts in this folder are utilities for the MGC SDKs. Most of them are written in
Python following PEP convention enforced by `flake8` and `black`.

One can run most of them with:

```shell
python3 <script> -h
```

## Scripts

### [sync_oapi.py](./sync_oapi.py):

Sync OpenAPI specs between internal implementation, which is a JSON generated from the
actual backend implementation (always updated) and the current external OpenAPI being
served.

Some transformations that need to be done on top of the current external spec:

1. Fix `server.urls` to match the external URLs
2. Replace any `requestBody` that mismatches from the internal spec, update with the
internal one
3. Change the error object since externals have a different Kong formatting for it

#### Running

For help:

```shell
python3 sync_oapi.py  --help
```

For running:

```shell
python3 sync_oapi.py <url-to-internal-spec> --ext <path-ext-yaml-spec> -o <output-path-new-ext>
```

Where url to internal spec is something like: "https://vm-region.proxy.com/openapi.json"

### [remove_tenant_id.py](./remove_tenant_id.py):

Some external OpenAPI specs were shared with endpoints expecting
`x-tenant-id` parameter in the header. However, this is not what we
will have in production. Thus, we need to remove this parameter from
the spec for now.

#### Running

For help:

```shell
python3 remove_tenant_id.py  --help
```

For running:

```shell
python3 remove_tenant_id.py <path-to-openapi-spec>
```

### [yaml_merge.py](./yaml_merge.py):

Merge some extras/customizations on top of an existing YAML, this is
useful to add `x-cli-name`, `x-cli-description` and `x-cli-hidden`
to an OpenAPI specification.

#### Running

For help:

```shell
python3 yaml_merge.py  --help
```

For running:

```shell

```shell
cd ..
python3 scripts/yaml_merge.py \
    mgc/cli/openapis/vpc.openapi.yaml \
    openapi-customizations/vpc.openapi.yaml
```
