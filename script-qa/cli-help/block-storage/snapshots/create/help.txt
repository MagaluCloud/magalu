Asynchronously create a Snapshot for the currently authenticated tenant.

The Snapshot can be used when it reaches the "available" state and the
 "completed" status.

#### Rules
- The Snapshot name must be unique; otherwise, the creation will be disallowed.
- Creating Snapshots from restored Volumes may lead to future conflicts as
 you can't delete a volume with an snapshot and can't delete a snapshot with a
 restored volume, so we recommend avoiding it.

#### Notes
- Use the **block-storage volume list** command to retrieve a list of all
 Volumes and obtain the ID of the volume that will be used to create the
 Snapshot.

Usage:
  ./cli block-storage snapshots create [flags]

Examples:
  ./cli block-storage snapshots create --volume.id="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" --volume.name="some_resource_name"

Flags:
      --cli.list-links enum[=table]   List all available links for this command (one of "json", "table" or "yaml")
      --description string            Description (required)
  -h, --help                          help for create
      --name string                   Name (required)
  -v, --version                       version for create
      --volume object                 Volume (at least one of: single property: id or single property: name)
                                      Use --volume=help for more details (required)
      --volume.id string              Volume: Id (min character count: 1)
                                      This is the same as '--volume=id:string'.
      --volume.name string            Volume: Name (between 1 and 255 characters)
                                      This is the same as '--volume=name:string'.
