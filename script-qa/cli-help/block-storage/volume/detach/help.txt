Detaches a volume from an instance. Make sure to unmount
any file systems on the device within your operating system before
detaching the volume. Failure to do so can result in the volume
becoming stuck in the busy state while detaching. If this happens,
detachment can be delayed indefinitely until you unmount the volume,
force detachment, reboot the instance, or all three.

Usage:
  ./cli block-storage volume detach [id] [virtual-machine-id] [flags]

Flags:
      --force                     Enforces detachment during the deletion process, allowing the volume to be forcefully
                                  detached even if it is currently in use.
  -h, --help                      help for detach

  -v, --version                   version for detach
