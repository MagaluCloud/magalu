Delete a Volume for the currently authenticated tenant.

#### Rules
- The Volume cannot be attached to a Virtual Machine, i.e., its state cannot
 be "in-use". If necessary, detach the Volume from the Virtual Machine before
 proceeding with deletion.

  snapshots before proceeding with deletion.

  actions in progress.
