Asynchronously change the Volume Type of an existing Volume for the currently
 authenticated tenant.

The Volume retype will be completed when the Volume status returns to
 "completed".

#### Rules
- The Volume state must be "available".
- The Volume status must be "completed" or "retype_error".
- The new Volume Type must belong to the same region as the Volume.

#### Notes
- Utilize the **block-storage volume list** command to retrieve a list of all
 Volumes and obtain the ID of the Volume you want to retype.
- Utilize the **block-storage volume-types list** command to retrieve a list of
 all Volume Types and obtain the ID of the Volume Type you want to use.
