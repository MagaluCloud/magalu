Asynchronously extend the size of an existing Volume for the currently
 authenticated tenant.

The Volume extension will be completed when the Volume status returns to
 "completed".

#### Rules
- The Volume status must be "available".
- The Volume status must be "completed" or "extend_error".
- The new Volume size must be larger than the current size.

#### Notes
- Utilize the block-storage volume list command to retrieve a list of all
 Volumes and obtain the ID of the volume you want to extend.
- Storage quotas are managed internally. If the operation fails due to quota
 restrictions, please contact our support team for assistance.
