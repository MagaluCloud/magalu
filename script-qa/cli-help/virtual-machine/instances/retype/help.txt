the id of the instance that you want to change the machine type.

#### Rules
- The instance must be in the running or stopped state.
- The new machine type must be compatible with the current machine type.
- The new machine type must be available in the same region as the current machine type.
- You must provide either the machine type id or the machine type name, if you provide both,
the machine type id will be used.
