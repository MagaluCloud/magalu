Profiles hold auth and runtime configuration for the MgcSDK, like tokens and log filter settings.
Users can create as many profiles as they choose to. Auth and config operations will affect only the
current profile, so users can alter and switch between profiles without loosing the previous configuration

Usage:
  ./cli profile [flags]
  ./cli profile [command]

Available Commands:
  create      Creates a new profile
  current     Shows current selected profile. Any changes to auth or config values will only affect this profile
  delete      Deletes the profile with the specified name
  list        List all available profiles
  set-current Sets profile to be used

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for profile

Global Flags:
      --cli.show-cli-globals   Show all CLI global flags on usage text

Use "./cli profile [command] --help" for more information about a command.
