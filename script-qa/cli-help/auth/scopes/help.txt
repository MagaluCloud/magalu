Some operations require scopes to be executed. These scopes
can be managed here, with operations that change the current
access token used in all other operations.

Usage:
  ./cli auth scopes [flags]
  ./cli auth scopes [command]

Commands:
  add          Add new scopes to the current access token
  list-all     List all available scopes for all commands
  list-current List scopes present in the current access token
  remove       Remove scopes from the current scopes in the access token.

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for scopes

Global Flags:
      --cli.show-cli-globals   Show all CLI global flags on usage text

Use "./cli auth scopes [command] --help" for more information about a command.
