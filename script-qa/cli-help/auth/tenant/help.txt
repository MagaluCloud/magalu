Magalu Cloud account and they each store their data separately, but are billed
under the same account

  ./cli auth tenant [flags]
  ./cli auth tenant [command]

Commands:
  current     Get the currently active Tenant
  list        List all available tenants for current login
  select      Set the active Tenant to be used for all subsequential requests

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for tenant

Global Flags:
      --cli.show-cli-globals   Show all CLI global flags on usage text

Use "./cli auth tenant [command] --help" for more information about a command.
