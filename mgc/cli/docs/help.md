# This CLI is a dynamic processor of OpenAPI files that
can generate a command line on-demand for Rest manipulation

## Usage:
```bash
Usage:
  ./mgc [flags]
  ./mgc [command]
```

## Product catalog:
- Product catalog:
- auth               Actions with ID Magalu to log in, refresh tokens, change tenants and others
- block-storage      Block Storage API Product Documentation
- config             Manage Configuration values
- container-registry Magalu Container Registry product API.
- dbaas              DBaaS API Product.
- events             # Consult API

## Other commands:
- With the continued growth of the distributed architecture in Magalu
- Cloud, everyone should have the ability to audit all (or important)
- events triggered by users or internal systems. This capability is
- essential not only for visualizing and tracking changes requested by
- internal developers but also for those made by tenant users. Our
- initial approach was to create a "broker" (i.e., an event system and a
- consultation API) that could store all these events. All events are
- exposed using the CloudEvent specification.

## Flags:
```bash
That API is a internal and External (filtered by Tenant ID) usage.
```
